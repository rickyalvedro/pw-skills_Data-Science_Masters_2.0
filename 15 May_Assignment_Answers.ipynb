        "\n",
        "# In Python, you do not need to explicitly specify the data type of the variable when declaring it. Python is dynamically typed, meaning that the data type of the variable is determined at runtime based on the value it is assigned. For example, in the code snippet above, x and y are considered integer variables because they are assigned integer values, while name and message are considered string variables because they are assigned string values.\n",

Also, variables should follow the rules for Python identifiers, which means they must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_) and can be followed by letters, digits, and underscores. They should not be Python keywords (reserved words)."
